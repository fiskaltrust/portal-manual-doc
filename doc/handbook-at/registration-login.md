![Number 2](../images/Numbers/2.png) Enter the name of the company for which the user is registering. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the company name usually corresponds to the name of the sole proprietor.

The field "Company name" is a mandatory field. The company name is to be indicated as with the establishment of the enterprise.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/3.png) Since the user is created as the company's so-called "primary contact", the user's e-mail address has already been added to the company and cannot be changed.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/4.png) Enter the master data of the company. This master data can be changed later in the ft.Portal and is also the basis for the voluntary display to be released by the user in [https://portal.fiskaltrust.at/public/filterpartners](https://portal.fiskaltrust.at/public/filterpartners). (see chapter "[Overview of roles and contractual relationships](company.md#overview-of-roles-and-conctractual-relationships)")

The fields _Zip Code_ and _City_ are mandatory fields.

If the company has a _UID number_, it should be entered. This can be used to prevent that a company which was already created in the ft.Portal is created again and therefore duplicated.

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/5.png) Since the subsequent registration of a company via the ft.Portal is currently not possible, the click should only be made if the user is to become active as an employee of an already registered company!
