![Screenshot-AT 10](images/portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.at/Account/006.png)
Screenshot-AT 10: Registration - Company (firm) | [https://portal.fiskaltrust.at/Account/Register](https://portal.fiskaltrust.at/Account/Register)

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/2.png) Enter the name of the company for which the user is registering. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the company name usually corresponds to the name of the sole proprietor.

The field "Company name" is a mandatory field. The company name is to be indicated as with the establishment of the enterprise.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/3.png) Since the user is created as the company's so-called "primary contact", the user's e-mail address has already been added to the company and cannot be changed.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/4.png) Enter the master data of the company. This master data can be changed later in the ft.Portal and is also the basis for the voluntary display to be released by the user in [https://portal.fiskaltrust.at/public/filterpartners](https://portal.fiskaltrust.at/public/filterpartners). (see chapter "[Overview of roles and contractual relationships](company.md#overview-of-roles-and-conctractual-relationships)")

The fields _Zip Code_ and _City_ are mandatory fields.

If the company has a _UID number_, it should be entered. This can be used to prevent that a company which was already created in the ft.Portal is created again and therefore duplicated.

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/5.png) Since the subsequent registration of a company via the ft.Portal is currently not possible, the click should only be made if the user is to become active as an employee of an already registered company!

At present the administration of all necessary functions can be carried out by the ft.Team. We are gladly available at [info@fiskaltrust.at](mailto:info@fiskaltrust.at).

It is possible for a user to be assigned to a company as an employee. It is not possible for a user to be deleted by the user via the ft.Portal you can only remove all access rights of a user.

Only an existing connection of a user to a company can be disconnected.

![Number 6](../images/Numbers/6.png) If you click on [Next], the next page of the registration process will only be opened after the mandatory fields have been filled out. The call up of the next page is to be waited for and can take also longer time.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/2.png) By clicking on the word "*click*"  or on the visible link ![Number 3](../images/Numbers/3.png) the portal is called up. By using the coded link the portal recognizes that this link was assigned for the confirmation of the e-mail address of the user and/or the company. This releases the user's e-mail address for the ft.Portal.

Now it is possible to log in with the newly created user data (e-mail address and personal password).
