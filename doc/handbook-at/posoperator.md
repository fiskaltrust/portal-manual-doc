### Invitation of PosOperators by PosDealers

The invitation of a PosOperator can only be made by a PosDealer, but not by a manufacturer or consultant.

However, the role of a PosDealer can also be activated by these companies and thus taken over in parallel to another role. (see chapter "[Company Role PosCreator](company.md#company-role-poscreator)")

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/1.png) The assignments of the PosOperators can be found under the menu item "Invitations".

There are two ways to add PosOperators to a PosDealer:

1. ![Number 2](../images/Numbers/2.png) add a single PosOperator see chapter [Add PosOperator](#add-posoperator).
2. ![Number 3](../images/Numbers/3.png) add several PosOperators by importing a CSV file.
    1. ![Number 4](../images/Numbers/4.png)  The CSV file is to be imported and selected via \[Choose File\].
    2. ![Number 5](../images/Numbers/5.png)  Then the import is carried out by clicking on \[Import\].
    3. ![Number 6](../images/Numbers/6.png)  The necessary structure of the CSV file is described using an example. This example can be obtained via \[Download demo CSV file\].

Screenshot-AT 46: Add PosOperator

PosOperators can be added manually using this function. This is particularly interesting for the on-site support given by the PosDealer if a PosOperator wants to use the ft.services immediately - in connection with the commissioning of a cash register.

The following fields are mandatory fields and must therefore be filled in:

- Contact E-Mail
- Contact First name
- Contact Surname
- company's name
- zip code
- location

This is to guarantee that the PosOperator can be found correctly in the ft.Portal via his e-mail address and can be assigned to the PosDealer.
