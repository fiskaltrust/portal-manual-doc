Screenshot-AT 53: Scanning a receipt via the ft.Portal

![Number 1](../images/../images/Numbers/1.png) Click on ![Scan](../images/Buttons/022.png "Scan") to activate functions for scanning receipts. This is only possible if the computer system you are using has a camera (webcam) installed.

![Number 2](../images/../images/Numbers/2.png) By clicking on the (large) image, the QR code can be photographed from a receipt. Then you can see the just created photo as a small icon under the big picture.

Only if a QR code is recognized, the image stops, otherwise it disappears again after a few seconds.

![Number 3](../images/../images/Numbers/3.png) A recognized QR code is marked with a red frame and can be transferred to the portal for further processing by clicking on the small image. To do this, you must log in to the portal with an existing login.

Thus a start or yearly receipt can be processed automatically in the ft.Portal afterwards.

Now the scanned receipt can be viewed in the portal under "Scanned QR Codes".
