These manuals are no longer maintained! 

In case of any questions, we encourage you to refer to our current **[fiskaltrust Documentation Platform](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/de/ "fiskaltrust Documentation Platform")**.

## General and important information

The manual describes the most important functions of the fiskaltrust.portal. Also note the abbreviations in the "List of abbreviations"

The individual pages described are sometimes called up with delays of up to 60 seconds. This is due to the fact that some very complex processes, such as a database search, are carried out in the background.

As many details on the fulfillment of the cash register obligation in 2016 were published at very short notice and not all processes can yet be tested on a larger scale (e.g. nationwide registration via Finanz Online), we apologise for any errors in the start-up phase. For larger applications, please contact our team in advance.

We are pleased about any information for the improvement of our services.
