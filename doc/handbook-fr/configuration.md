Overview - First configuration container 

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> After creating a CashBox, it is initially empty, it only has the _CashBoxID_ and the _AccessToken_ which are required to access the CashBox. It can be seen by opening the information section by clicking on the chevron on the beginning of the line.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> This area shows all the assigned queues, helpers and SCUs for the configuration container. Since the CashBox has just been created and nothing is stored yet, the fields are empty.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-3o.svg" width="24px"> By clicking on ![dotnet Launcher](../images/Buttons/024.png "dotnet Launcher") you can download the _dotnet Launcher_. This must be used if there is an internet connection to the cash register.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-4o.svg" width="24px"> The _dotnet useOffline Launcher_ should be used if no internet connection can be established. This can be downloaded by clicking on ![Download](../images/Buttons/025.png "Download").

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-5o.svg" width="24px"> For using the fiskaltrust.Service with a MacOS or Linux system the _mono useOffline Launcher_ is needed. It can be downloaded by clicking on ![mono Launcher](../images/Buttons/026.png "mono Launcher"). This is set to _useOffline_ by default.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-6o.svg" width="24px"> If an _ArchiveAuditable_ has not yet been purchased, the purchase can be made by clicking on ![Dollarsign](../images/Buttons/020.png "Dollarsign"). If a package has already been purchased, the validity date is displayed here.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-7o.svg" width="24px"> The CashBox can be edited with a click on ![Drag&Drop](../images/Buttons/027.png "Drag&Drop") by Drag & Drop.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-8o.svg" width="24px"> The CashBox can also be edited in a list view by clicking on ![List](../images/Buttons/028.png "List").

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-9o.svg" width="24px"> By clicking on ![Trash](../images/Buttons/029.png "Trash") an empty configuration container can be deleted.

#### Edit CashBox by Drag & Drop

Edit CashBox by Drag & Drop

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> The first widget shows all the created queues in this account. This corresponds to a data acquisition protocol and therefore a POS-System.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> The second widget shows all created Helpers, which can be used in a CashBox. For further information see chapter [_Helpers_](../handbook-general/configuration.md#helper).

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-3o.svg" width="24px"> The last widget contains all the SCUs created in this account and can be used in a CashBox, further information can be found in chapter [_Signature creation unit_](#SCU).<br>A SCU must not be directly associated to a CashBox. Because the configuration container has a connection to the outlet and the SCU is coupled to an outlet, a loose coupling exists between them. It is essential for legal compliance to use the same outlet number in the SCU-configuration and the CashBox-configuration.<br>This loose coupling enables the usage of a single SCU for more than one queue in the same outlet.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-4o.svg" width="24px"> The field _Outlet_ is mandatory and must contain the number of a valid outlet. For further information see chapter [_Outlets_](company.md#outlets).

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-5o.svg" width="24px"> This field contains the active CashBox. Using Drag & Drop, units from the three widgets on the right side can be integrated in this CashBox.

Clicking on [Save] stores the changes to the configuration container.

#### Edit CashBox by List

Furthermore, the CashBox can be edited via a list.
[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/Edit-List.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Edit CashBox by list

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> The list view is divided into three sections showing the available objects (_Queues_, _Helper_, _Signature creation Unit_).

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> The required objects can be added to the cashbox by ticking the checkbox at the beginning if the row.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-3o.svg" width="24px"> Click ![Gear](../images/Buttons/030.png "Gear") on the ending of a row to display the settings for each object.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-4o.svg" width="24px"> Each Queue owns a certificate from a SCU for signing all the data send to it. With the button ![Certificate download](../images/Buttons/039.png "Certificate download") the certificate of a assigned SCU can be downloaded and verified.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-5o.svg" width="24px"> For filtering all the tables/sections in this window at least 3 characters have to be entered. 

#### Ready configured CashBox

Ready configured CashBox

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> By clicking on [+&nbsp;Add] you can create a new configuration container (CashBox).

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> In the section _Queues_ the deposited POS-System identification number (_CashBoxID_) as well as the automatically generated AES key (Base64 encryption) (_AccessToken_) can be found.<br> By clicking on ![Gear](../images/Buttons/030.png "Gear") the confiiguration of the queue can be edited.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-3o.svg" width="24px"> In this section the connected helpers as well as the package name and version is shown. By clicking on ![Gear](../images/Buttons/030.png "Gear") each helper can be configured in its own window.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-4o.svg" width="24px"> The connected signature creation units can be displayed here. But it is not necessary to connect a CashBox one-to-one to a SCU. Because a SCU can be used more than once for an outlet there is a loose connection between SCU and CashBox.

#### Delete a CashBox
For legal reasons it is currently not possible to delete a CashBox. However, there is the exception, that if the CashBox was not yet in use, it can still be deleted.

Before deleting a CashBox it has to be ensured that all elements from the configuration container are removed. Removing the element from the CashBox does not delete them, they are only put back in the general section for further use.<br>If a CashBox is not empty it can not be deleted.<br>By deleting a CashBox only the wrapping configuration container gets removed from the system. No data, certificate, queue, archives or anything else is touched or deleted.

Overview - Signature Creation Units (SCU)

To find a specific SCU, a text can be entered in the search field<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px">. Starting with the second entered character the table beneath gets filtered automatically.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> Clicking on [+&nbsp;Create] opens the module for creating a new signature creation unit, see [_Creation of a SCU_](#creation-of-a-scu).

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-3o.svg" width="24px"> The SIRET used by the SCU is displayed here. This reflects the loose coupling of the SCU to the outlet, see for more information chapter [_Outlets_](company.md#outlets).

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-4o.svg" width="24px"> Shows the serial number of the certificate of the SCU. 

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-5o.svg" width="24px"> Each SCU holds a certificate for signing all the data send to it. With the button ![Certificate download](../images/Buttons/047.png "Certificate download") the certificate of this SCU can be downloaded and verified.

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-6o.svg" width="24px"> Click on ![Delete SCU](../images/Buttons/029.png "Delete SCU") to delete the SCU. However, the button to delete any signature creation unit is currently inactive for legal reasons, so no SCU can be deleted.

Adding a signature creation unit

To create the signature creation unit, command _Signature creation device_<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> in the _Configuration_<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> menu. A click on [+&nbsp;Create] opens the page for adding a new SCU to the company.

In the dropdown list all [outlets](company.md#outlets) of the company are shown. To create a SCU, an outlet has to be selected. It is not necessary to create more then one SCU for an outlet, but at least one per outlet has to be created. It is not possible to use one signature creation unit for more then one outlet because the SIRET of the selected outlet is used to created the certificate for each SCU.

#### Add signature creation unit

To connect a SCU to a CashBox or more specifically to a queue see [Outlets](company.md#outlets) and[SCUs used by a queue](#scus-used-by-a-queue)

#### Delete a signature creation unit

The button for deleting a signature creation unit is, for legal reasons, inactive. No created SCU can be deleted from the fiskaltrust.Service. In the future there will be a filter to hide unused or inactive SCUs.
