Before starting with the configuration, the master data of the enterprise and the outlet has to be completed and checked. For this see chapter [_Master data_](company.md#company-master-data) and [_Outlets_](company.md#outlets)

### CashBox<a name="Cashbox"></a>

#### Creation of a CashBox

[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/CashBox.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Creating the configuration containers

By opening the menu _Configuration_![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) and clicking on _CashBox_![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) the overview of all configured CashBoxes (configuration containers) is shown.
Click on [+&nbsp;Add]![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) to create a new configuration container.

#### Add a CashBox

[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/Create.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Configuration container - Add

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) In this field, you can change the name of the configuration container. It should be unique so a CashBox can be identified in even a long list.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) If you are working in a network mode, enter the IP address of the endpoint here.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) Click on \[Save\] to save the changes to the configuration container ad go back to the overview.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) Clicking \[Cancel\] cancels the operation without saving the changes and show the overview.

#### Overview first CashBox<a name ="overview-firstcashbox"></a>

[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/CashBox-Details.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Overview - First configuration container

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) After creating a CashBox, it is initially empty, it only has the _CashBoxID_ and the _AccessToken_ which are required to access the CashBox. It can be seen by opening the information section by clicking on the chevron on the beginning of the line.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) This area shows all the assigned queues, helpers and SCUs for the configuration container. Since the CashBox has just been created and nothing is stored yet, the fields are empty.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) By clicking on ![dotnet Launcher](../images/Buttons/024.png "dotnet Launcher") you can download the _dotnet Launcher_. This must be used if there is an internet connection to the POS-System.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) The _dotnet useOffline Launcher_ should be used if no internet connection can be established. This can be downloaded by clicking on ![Download](../images/Buttons/025.png "Download").

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) For using the fiskaltrust.Middleware with a MacOS or Linux system the _mono useOffline Launcher_ is needed. It can be downloaded by clicking on ![mono Launcher](../images/Buttons/026.png "mono Launcher"). This is set to _useOffline_ by default.

![Number 6](../images/Numbers/circle-6o.png) The CashBox can be edited with a click on ![Drag&Drop](../images/Buttons/027.png "Drag&Drop") by Drag & Drop.

![Number 7](../images/Numbers/circle-7o.png) The CashBox can also be edited in a list view by clicking on ![List](../images/Buttons/028.png "List").

![Number 8](../images/Numbers/circle-8o.png) By clicking on ![Trash](../images/Buttons/029.png "Trash") an empty configuration container can be deleted.

#### Edit CashBox by Drag & Drop

[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/Edit-DragDrop.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Edit CashBox by Drag & Drop

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) The first widget shows all the created queues in this account. This corresponds to a data acquisition protocol and therefore a POS-System.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) The second widget shows all created Helpers, which can be used in a CashBox. For further information see chapter [_Helpers_](../handbook-general/configuration.md#helper).

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) The last widget contains all the SCUs created in this account and can be used in a CashBox, further information can be found in chapter [_Signature creation unit_](#SCU).<br />A SCU must not be directly associated to a CashBox. Because the configuration container has a connection to the outlet and the SCU is coupled to an outlet, a loose coupling exists between them. It is essential for legal compliance to use the same outlet number in the SCU-configuration and the CashBox-configuration.<br />This loose coupling enables the usage of a single SCU for more than one queue in the **same** outlet.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) The field _Outlet_ is mandatory and must contain the number of a valid outlet. For further information see chapter [_Outlets_](company.md#outlets).

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) This field contains the active CashBox. Using Drag & Drop, units from the three widgets on the right side can be integrated in this CashBox.

Clicking on \[Save\] stores the changes to the configuration container.

#### Edit CashBox by List

Furthermore, the CashBox can be edited via a list.
[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/Edit-List.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Edit CashBox by list

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) The list view is divided into three sections showing the available objects (_Queues_, _Helper_, _Signature Creation Unit_).

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) The required objects can be added to the cashbox by ticking the checkbox at the beginning of the row.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) Click ![Gear](../images/Buttons/030.png "Gear") on the ending of a row to display the settings for each object.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) Each Queue owns a certificate from a SCU for signing all the data send to it. With the button ![Certificate download](../images/Buttons/039.png "Certificate download") the certificate of a assigned SCU can be downloaded and verified.

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) For filtering all the tables/sections in this window at least 3 characters have to be entered.

#### Ready configured CashBox

[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/Cashbox-Detail-Configured.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.at/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Ready configured CashBox

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) By clicking on \[+ Add\] you can create a new configuration container (CashBox).

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) In the section _Queues_ the deposited POS-System identification number (_CashBoxID_) as well as the automatically generated AES-key (Base64 encryption) (_AccessToken_) can be found.<br /> By clicking on ![Gear](../images/Buttons/030.png "Gear") the configuration of the queue can be edited.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) In this section the connected helpers as well as the package name and version is shown. By clicking on ![Gear](../images/Buttons/030.png "Gear") each helper can be configured in its own window.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) The connected signature creation units can be displayed here. But it is not necessary to connect a CashBox one-to-one to a SCU. Because a SCU can be used more than once for an outlet there is a loose connection between SCU and CashBox.

#### Delete a CashBox

For legal reasons it is currently not possible to delete a CashBox. However, there is one exception, that if the CashBox was not yet in use and is completly empty, it can still be deleted.

Before deleting a CashBox it has to be ensured that all elements from the configuration container are removed. Removing the element from the CashBox does not delete them, they are only put back in the general section for further use.<br />If a CashBox is not empty it can not be deleted.<br />By deleting a CashBox only the wrapping configuration container gets removed from the system. No data, certificate, queue, archives or anything else is touched or deleted.
[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/Delete.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)

#### Download Launcher

[![https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox](images/CashBox/CashBox-Download-Launcher.png "http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox")](http://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/CashBox)
Download Launcher

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) By clicking on one of these buttons, the launcher needed for commissioning is downloaded. This is a ZIP file that you download into the download folder. The zip-file can be founded in the local download-folder and extracted there for further use on a POS-System.
Be aware, that after changement in the configuration the \[Rebuild\]-button should be click before a launcher is downloaded.

For further information see chapter [Overview first CashBox](#overview-firstcashbox)

### Queue<a name="queue"></a>

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/](images/Queue/Queue.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/)
Overview of queues

To get to the creation and _Configuration_![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) of a queue, click on the menu item _Queue_![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png).

To find a specific queue, a text can be entered in the search field![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png). Starting with the second entered character, the table beneath gets filtered automatically.

A click on the button _+&nbsp;Create new_![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) adds a new queue to the account.

#### Add a queue<a name="add-a-queue"></a>

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/](images/Queue/Create.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/)
Queue - Adding

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) This field, holds the name of the queue. It can be anything which helps to identify each single queue in the account.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) The appropriate storage method depending on your operating system can be selected. This value cannot be changed after the creation of the queue.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) The package version can also be selected using a dropdown menu. For updating the package version a click on ![Refresh](../images/Buttons/008.png "Refresh") is mandatory.<br />**To configure the POS-System with a law compliant fiskaltrust.Middleware the correct package has to be selected. The certified version for the used POS-System, is written on the certificate. Your PosDealer or PosCreator knows which version is certified and must be used.**

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) Sets a timeout in milliseconds for the connection attempt with the signature creation unit.

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) The country in which the queue is used can be selected in this dropdown list. This value can not be changed after creation of the queue.<br />**For a law compliant configuration _France (FR)_ has to be chosen.**

![Number 6](../images/Numbers/circle-6o.png) This identification value has to be unique in the account. This value can not be changed after creation of the queue.

![Number 7](../images/Numbers/circle-7o.png) The \[Save\]-button creates the queue and stores it.

#### Queue configuration<a name="configure-a-queue"></a>

The configuration has to be done directly after the creation of a queue. Nevertheless it can be changed afterwards with the ![Configuration](../images/Buttons/009.png "Configuration") button in the queue overview.

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/](images/Queue/Configuration.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/)
Queue configuration

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) This box can be ticked to activate the verification of the connected certificate.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) Activating this option speeds up the signing of the first certificate, but slows down the queue starting.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) This line gives the possibility to add a key-value-pair to the configuration of the queue.<br />![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) The ![add line](../images/Buttons/042.png "add line") button adds another line for a new pair and the ![remove line](../images/Buttons/043.png "remove line") button removes the line from the configuration.

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) The name of the queue can be changed in this field.

![Number 6](../images/Numbers/circle-6o.png) The type of storage can only be defined upon queue creation and can not be changed later on.

![Number 7](../images/Numbers/circle-7o.png) The package version can also be selected using a dropdown menu. For updating the package version a click on ![Refresh](../images/Buttons/008.png "Refresh") is mandatory.<br />**To configure the POS-System with a law compliant fiskaltrust.Middleware the correct package has to be selected. The certified version for the used POS-System, is written on the certificate. Your PosDealer or PosCreator knows which version is certified and must be used.**

![Number 8](../images/Numbers/circle-8o.png) The URL to access the queue can be defined in this field. By clicking on ![net pipe](../images/Buttons/012.png "net pipe") a URL is used, which is suitable for local use without internet connection, because no firewall settings are required. By clicking on ![http](../images/Buttons/013.png "http"), the system generates a URL with which the POS-System can access the queue. The URL can be renamed, to have it like this: http://localhost:1200/Queuefiskaltrust.<br />The ![add URL](../images/Buttons/042.png "add URL") button adds another line for a new URL and the ![remove URL](../images/Buttons/043.png "remove URL") button removes the URL from the configuration.

![Number 9](../images/Numbers/circle-9o.png) \[Save\] or \[Save and close\] saves the configuration of the queue (and closes the configuration module).

#### Queue overview<a name="queue-overview"></a>

By opening the _Queue_-Module in the _Configuration_-menu an overview from all created queues are shown.

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/](images/Queue/Queue-New.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Queue/)
Queue overview

![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) Clicking on the _chevron right_ shows the base information for this queue and the used CashBox, if already configured.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) This column shows the localisation (for which country the queue is used) and the _CashBox identification_.

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) The third column contains a checkmark ![Checkmark](../images/Buttons/044.png "Checkmark") when the queue is activated. A _start receipt_ has been sent and the queue is ready to sign and chain receipts or already contains some receipts.<br />If this column is empty no start receipt has been sent or a _stop receipt_ was sent and the queue does not accept any receipts for chaining and signing.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) A queue contains two type of journals. Both of them are chained and secured against changes and contain already transmitted receipts.<br />By clicking on ![ReceiptJournal](../images/Buttons/017.png "ReceiptJournal") all transmitted receipts are displayed in a list, see chapter [_ReceiptJournal of a queue_](#receiptjournal-of-a-queue).<br />By clicking on ![ActionJournal](../images/Buttons/018.png "ActionJournal") all important actions and status changes of the queue are shown in a list, see chapter [_ActionJournal of a queue_](#actionjournal-of-a-queue).

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) To stop the transmission from the local POS-System to the queue the ![Disable upload](../images/Buttons/045.png "Disable upload") button can be clicked. Starting from this moment the queue does not save any receipt in the cloud. With ![Reset upload](../images/Buttons/046.png "Reset upload") the queue receives all the untransmitted receipts from the moment the button is clicked. This can be take several days because the check for missing receipts is started by the first receipt saved in the local queue.

![Number 6](../images/Numbers/circle-6o.png) The queue export can be started by pressing the button ![Export](../images/Buttons/019.png "Export"). For further information see chapter [_Export a queue_](#export-a-queue).

![Number 8](../images/Numbers/circle-8o.png) The last column contains the commands to manage a queue.<br /> By clicking on ![Used french signature creation unit](../images/Buttons/021.png "Used french signature creation unit") the connected SCUs can be displayed and managed. For further information see chapter [_SCUs used by a queue_](#scus-used-by-a-queue).<br />Here the configuration of the queue can be opened by clicking on ![Configure queue](../images/Buttons/009.png "Configure queue"), see [_Configure a queue_](#configure-a-queue).<br />Clicking on ![Edit](../images/Buttons/005.png "Edit") edits the description, package version and timeout of the queue, see [_Edit a queue_](#edit-a-queue).<br />Clicking on ![Trash](../images/Buttons/011.png "Trash") deletes the queue. However, the button for deleting the queue **is inactive for legal reasons**, so no queue can be deleted after creation. The possibility to delete a queue does not depend on the status or the content of a queue. Once created no deletion is possible.

The SCU is the part of the fiskaltrust.Middleware for securing all the receipts sent to it. In France the SCU is the holder of the certificate to guarantee the unalterability, securtiy, conservation and archiving of the transmitted data.

#### Overview of signature creation units

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/SignatureCreationUnit/](images/SignatureCreationUnit/SignatureCreationUnit.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/SignatureCreationUnit/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/SignatureCreationUnit/)
Overview - Signature Creation Units (SCU)

To find a specific SCU, a text can be entered in the search field![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png). Starting with the second entered character the table beneath gets filtered automatically.

![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) Clicking on [+&nbsp;Create] opens the module for creating a new signature creation unit, see [_Creation of a SCU_](#creation-of-a-scu).

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) The SIRET used by the SCU is displayed here. This reflects the loose coupling of the SCU to the outlet, see for more information chapter [_Outlets_](company.md#outlets).

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) Shows the serial number of the certificate of the SCU. 

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) Each SCU holds a certificate for signing all the data send to it. With the button ![Certificate download](../images/Buttons/047.png "Certificate download") the certificate of this SCU can be downloaded and verified.

![Number 6](../images/Numbers/circle-6o.png) Click on ![Delete SCU](../images/Buttons/029.png "Delete SCU") to delete the SCU. However, the button to delete any signature creation unit is currently inactive for legal reasons, so no SCU can be deleted.

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/SignatureCreationUnitFR/](images/SignatureCreationUnitFR/Create.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/SignatureCreationUnitFR/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/SignatureCreationUnitFR/)
Adding a signature creation unit

To create the signature creation unit, command _Signature creation device_![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png) in the _Configuration_![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) menu. A click on [+&nbsp;Create] opens the page for adding a new SCU to the company.

In the dropdown list all [outlets](company.md#outlets) of the company are shown. To create a SCU, an outlet has to be selected. It is not necessary to create more then one SCU for an outlet, but at least one per outlet has to be created. It is not possible to use one signature creation unit for more then one outlet because the SIRET of the selected outlet is used to created the certificate for each SCU.

#### Add signature creation unit

To connect a SCU to a CashBox or more specifically to a queue see [Outlets](company.md#outlets) and[SCUs used by a queue](#scus-used-by-a-queue)

#### Delete a signature creation unit

The button for deleting a signature creation unit is, for legal reasons, inactive. No created SCU can be deleted from the fiskaltrust.Middleware. In the future there will be a filter to hide unused or inactive SCUs.

### Template

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Template/](images/Template/Template.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Template/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Template/)
List of available templates

Instead of creating and configuring a CashBox manually, a template (payable or free of charge) can be used. This preconfigured template can be purchased in the fiskaltrust.Shop. With this kind of template many similar CashBoxes can be created easily and further used as described in the chapter [_CashBox_](#cashbox).

If you are in need of templates for creating and configurating CashBoxes, do not hesitate to contact the support at contact@fiskaltrust.fr. fiskaltrust France is happy to help you to reach this goal.

The template management can be found in _Configuration_![Number 1](../images/Numbers/circle-1o.png) at the command _Template_![Number 2](../images/Numbers/circle-2o.png)

![Number 3](../images/Numbers/circle-3o.png) In the first column the template name is shown. More information regarding the template will be shown after a click on the chevron right.

![Number 4](../images/Numbers/circle-4o.png) Shows the status of the template. It can be completely deactivated, visible for everyone or only for connected PosDealers and/or PosOperators.

![Number 5](../images/Numbers/circle-5o.png) A click on [+&nbsp;Create new] creates a new template from scratch.

![Number 6](../images/Numbers/circle-6o.png) A click on ![Clone template](../images/Buttons/033.png "Clone template") clones the template and opens the newly created template for changes.

![Number 7](../images/Numbers/circle-7o.png) The button ![Edit](../images/Buttons/005.png "Edit") opens the template for changes.

#### Create template

[![https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Template/](images/Template/Create.png "https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Template/")](https://portal.fiskaltrust.fr/Template/)
Create a template

The first two fields give the template a clear name and description. In the field _Content_ the commands for this template are saved. This will be normally prefilled from the fiskaltrust.Support.<br />
In _ImageUrl_ an absolute URL to a kind of product image can be stored. For more description of this template an absolute URL can be entered in _LinkUrl_.<br />
The dropdown list in _Mode_ defines the access rights for a template by choosing one of the elements.

A template always start with

```
{ "ftCashBoxId": "|[cashbox_id]|",​
     "ftQueues": [​{​"Id": "|[queue0_id]|",
```

Then add queue type: `"Package": "fiskaltrust.service.azure",`
The type of packages can be found in the dropdown list of [creating a new queue](#add-a-queue).

Then introduce queue parameters, anew block has to be started: `"Configuration": {`

For example a connection string can be included `"connectionstring": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http://endpoint.cloud;AccountName=ftRealAccountName;AccountKey=TheACcountKey;",`

or other queue parameter, like `"asscdtretry": 2,`

Then beginning of the queue core starts with

```
"init_ftQueue": [{ "ftQueueId": "|[queue0_id]|",
                   "ftCashBoxId": "|[cashbox_id]|",
                   "CountryCode": "FR",
                   "Timeout": 15000 }],
```

and the specific of the country

```
"init_ftQueueFR": [ { "ftQueueFRId": "|[queue0_id]|",
```

but also the queue name

```
"CashBoxIdentification": "ChaîneCloud|[count]|" } ],
```

then the SCU that this queues connect to:

```
"ftSignaturCreationUnitFRId": "|[scu0_id]|",
```

and the SIRET used for this queue:

```
"Siret": "|[siret]|",
```

To initialize a SCU for a queue the following block can be used:

```
"init_ftSignaturCreationUnitFR": [{
        "ftSignaturCreationUnitFRId": "|[scu0_id]|",
        "Siret": "|[siret]|",
        "CompanyName": "|[company_name]|",
        "CountryCode": "FR",
        "OutletNumber": "|[outlet_number]|"
    }
]
```

As last parameter the endpoint for the ChaîneCloud product has to be defined:

```
"Url": ["https://signaturcloud-azure-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/"]
```

##### Example of a standard template

```

### Automating CashBox creation

The template system of fiskaltrust can be used for creating a large number of CashBoxes. There is one restriction: **It cannot be used for creating CashBoxes with ChaîneCloud!**

For this purpose, fiskaltrust provides an HTTP API which can be used in the sandbox (https://helipad-sandbox.fiskaltrust.cloud/api/configuration) but also in the live environment (https://helipad.fiskaltrust.cloud/api/configuration).

#### API-Call

Various requirements are necessary to call up the API.

1. You need the `AccountID` and the `AccessToken`, which you can find in your company account (https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.fr/AccountProfile) at the bottom of the page.
2. You need the _SIRET_, _Company Name_ and _Outlet_-Number.
3. The template as JSON string.

The request has to be send with the method `POST` with set to `application/json`. The header has to contain the variables `accountid` and `accesstoken` for which the template should be executed.

#### General information

Variables are identified by specifying them within `|[` and `]|`. It is possible to specify system variables whose values are generated by the fiskaltrust.System during generation as well as to specify your own variables whose values can be transferred later via an API call to generate the CashBox.

In first line of the following example, the system variable: `|[cashbox_id]|` is specified as the value for `ftCashBoxId`. This is the CashboxID, a value that is automatically generated by the system and used at this point to identify later the CashBox.

In the fifth line, on the other hand, a separate variable is used (`|[siret]|`) whose concrete value can be passed later during the API call.

#### Data structure

| Name | Data type | Mandatory<br />Default | Description |
|------|-----------|------------------------|-------------|
| `ftCashBoxId` | `GUID` (string)<br />GUID | yes | Identifies the CashBox in the fiskaltrust.System and must therefore be unique. Will later become part of the authentication of the CashBox. The system variable `|[cashbox_id]|` should be used here to automatically generate a GUID. |
| `ftSignaturCreationDevices` | `PackageConfiguration[]` | no  | Array, contains the configurations of the SCUs to be used. |
| `helpers`| `PackageConfiguration[]` | no  | Array, contains the configurations of the Helpers to be used. |
| `ftQueues`| `PackageConfiguration[]` | yes | Array, contains the configurations of the Queues to be used. |
| `TimeStamp`| `DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks` | no  | Time of creation of the template. |

##### Example
```
{
    "ftCashBoxId": "|[cashbox_id]|",
    "ftSignaturCreationDevices": [{}],
    "helpers": [{}],
    "ftQueues": [{}]
}
```

#### Standard variables for PackageConfiguration

With all `PackageConfiguration`-object the follwoing variables can be used. Depending on each object the possible values can differ.

| Name | Data type | Mandatory<br />Default | Description |
|------|-----------|------------------------|-------------|
| `Id` | `GUID` (string)<br />GUID | yes | Identifies the instance of the element that is configured here (SCU, Queue or Helper). A maximum of the instances can be used (`queue{0-9}_id`, `scu{0-9}_id` or `helper{0-9}_id`. |
| `Package` | `string` | yes | Name of the package to be used to create the element. E. g. _fiskaltrust.service.sqlite_ for a Queue that is installed locally. Currently supported packages can be found below. |
| `Description` |  `string` | no  | Descriptive name of the element.<br />Can only be changed be using it as a parameter in the query string. |
| `Version` | `string`<br />latest version | yes | Version of the package to be used to create the element. If no version is specified, the latest version is used. For France only defined versions are allowed for using with the Queue: **1.2.21138.42021** |
| `Configuration` | `Object` (string) | no  | Configuration parameters for the element. |
| `URL` | `string[]`<br />automatic | no | Array, communication endpoints of the element. E.g. REST endpoint for communication with the queue.<br /> The default value is `http://localhost:1200/` and the GUID of the package. |

##### Query string

In the query string the description for several packages are included. This is the only way to overwrite the default values.

```
https://helipad-sandbox.fiskaltrust.cloud/api/configuration?outlet_number=26&siret=12345678912345&cashbox_description=CB_Local%20Outlet%20N%C2%B0%2026_18&queue0_description=QU_Local%20Outlet%20N%C2%B0%2026_18&scu0_description=SCU_Local%20Outlet%20N%C2%B0%2026_18&company_name=fiskaltrust%20SAS&helper0_description=REST_Local%20Outlet%20N%C2%B0%2026_18
```

#### Response of the API call

The API sends a response with all the initial values back to the sender. This JSON contains three objects: `cashBoxId`, `accessToken` and `configuration`. With this you can do an automatic rollout.

Download at first the _Online Launcher_ form the fiskaltrust.Portal. This is a general zip-File with all the necessary files to run the fiskaltrust.Middleware on a local system.

It is important to ensure that the fiskaltrust.Middleware is initialized correctly, i.e. with the corresponding CashBox. The launcher provides a configuration file (`fiskaltrust.exe.config`) for this purpose. You can adapt this accordingly before rolling out the launcher to the operator's CashBox.

Please enter the values for `cashboxid` and `accesstoken` in the `appSetting` area you received as answer from the API-call.

```
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="cashboxid" value="your-cashbox-id" />
    <add key="accesstoken" value="your-access-token" />
  </appsettings>
</configuration>
```

Now you can deliver the launcher with the customized configuration file to the operator's POS system and start it with `fiskaltrust.exe` or install it with `install-service.cmd`. The launcher will automatically download the configuration container for the `cashboxid` specified in `fiskaltrust.exe.config` from the fiskaltrust.Server and configure and start the fiskaltrust.Middleware accordingly.

Alternatively to adjusting the configuration in the `fiskaltrust.exe.config` file, you can pass the `cashboxid` and the `accesstoken` as parameters when starting the launcher (`fiskaltrust.exe`). This specification overwrites the existing configuration. The description of the possible start parameters can be found in the [middleware documentation](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/doc/interface-doc/doc/general/installation/installation.html).
