## PosOperator

### Invitation of PosOperators by PosDealers

The invitation of a PosOperator can only be made by a PosDealer and not by a PosCreator or consultant.

However, the role of a PosDealer can also be activated by these companies and thus taken over in parallel to another role. (see chapter "[Roles](company.md#roles)")

PosOperator - Overview

By opening the PosOperator menu<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> an _Overview_<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> with the assigned PosOperators is shown.

The assignments of the PosOperators can be found under the menu item _Invitation_<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-3o.svg" width="24px">.

There are two ways to add/assign PosOperators to a PosDealer:

1. For adding a single PosOperator, see chapter [_Add PosOperator_](#add-posoperator).
2. Adding several PosOperators by importing a CSV file with _Invitation_.

Invite PosOperators to a PosDealer account

<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> The CSV file is to be imported and selected via [Choose File].
<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> Then the import is carried out by clicking on [Import].
<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-3o.svg" width="24px"> The necessary structure of the CSV file is described using an example. This example can be obtained via [Download demo CSV file].

| Fields of the CSV file | Description | Mandatory |
|------------------------|-------------|:---------:|
| ContactFirstName | First name of the primary contact | yes |
| ContactLastName | Last name of primary contact | yes |
| ContactTitle | (Academic) Title of primary contact (before name) | no |
| ContactSuffix | Name suffix of the primary contact (after the name) | no |
| ContactEmail | Email address of the primary contact<br>**IMPORTANT!**<br>This email address will be the user's login to the newly created company. | yes |
| ContactMobilePhone | Mobile phone number of the primary contact | no |
| AccountName | Company name, this should be written exactly as it is in the commercial register | yes |
| AccountWeb | URL of the company's website | no |
| AccountEmail |General email address of the company<br>**IMPORTANT!**<br>All information about financial messages and all invoices will be sent to this email address! | no |
| AccountPhone | Company phone number | no |
| AccountAddressLine1 | Address, first line of the company | no |
| AccountAddressLine2 | Address, second line of the company | no |
| AccountPostalCode | Postcode of the company | yes |
| AccountCity | Address, first line of the company | yes |
| AccountCountry | Address, first line of the company | yes |
| AccountIdVat | UID number of the company.<br>**IMPORTANT!**<br>This is one of the identification criterias for legalisation of the service. | yes |
| AccountIdFibu| The _SIREN_ of the company<br>**IMPORTANT!**<br>This is one of the identification criterias for legalisation of the service. | yes |
| AccountIdGln | GLN of the company. | no |
| AccountIdTax | Tax office tax number of the company. | yes |

Not all of the fields _AccountIdVat_, _AccountIdTax_ and _AccountIdFibu_ are mandatory. Only one of the three fields have to be completed. It is recommended to use the field _AccountIdFibu_.

A pdf-file can be first choosen<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-4o.svg" width="24px"> and then imported<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-5o.svg" width="24px"> as a PDF document, which is sent to the PosOperators as an attachment in the email invitations. This PDF document can be individually adapted to the rollout concept.

Before sending the invitation to all PosOperators listed in the csv file a text message<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-6o.svg" width="24px"> can be added to this invitation email.

By accepting the invitation the PosOperator gets assigned to the PosDealer's account and thus get some access rights on the PosOperators account. This surrogating of rights can be defined in the claims list<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-7o.svg" width="24px">.

Add PosOperator manually

PosOperators can be added manually using this function, by clicking the [+&nbsp;Add]-button in the PosOperator's list head section. This is particularly interesting for the on-site support given by the PosDealer, if a PosOperator wants to use the ft.Services immediately - in connection with the commissioning of a POS-System.

The following fields are mandatory fields and must therefore be filled in:

- Contact First name
- Contact Surname
- Contact Email address
- Company's name
- Zip code
- City
- Location

This is to guarantee that the PosOperator can be found correctly in the ft.Portal via his email address and can be assigned to the PosDealer.
