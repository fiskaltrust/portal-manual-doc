The _Name_<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-1o.svg" width="24px"> identifies the outlet in all lists used in the fiskaltrust.Portal. This field is only for internal use and helps you to identify the outlet. The _Outlet number_<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-2o.svg" width="24px"> is an internal number for the fiskaltrust.Portal. But the number has to be an integer and unique for each outlet. With this identifier the CashBox (_**TODO LINK**_) can be connected to the outlet.

This check acts exactly like the [_SIREN Data Check_](#siren-data-check-passed) in the _Master Data_. Therefore, be able to use the outlet for a CashBox this data check has to be returned positive.

The fields shown at <img src="../images/Numbers/circle-4o.svg" width="24px"> _Address_, _Postal code_ and _City_ are not mandatory by the ft.Portal but should be completed. For a control by the financial authorities this can be proof of correct data management. Further on this field can be used from the fiskaltrust.Service to print the outlet's address on any receipt.

Once all data is completed and the data check performed positive the outlet data can be sent to the storage with the [Save]-Button.<img src="../images/Numbers/circle-6o.svg" width="24px">
