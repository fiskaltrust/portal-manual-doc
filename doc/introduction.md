# Introduction

These manuals described the functions of the fiskaltrust.Portal, both in general and for the particular markets in which fiskaltrust operates.

:::danger **No maintenance anymore**

We have updated and consolidated our documentation for PosCreators and PosDealers and will keep it up-to-date. As a result, we will no longer maintain any manuals.  
In case of any questions, we encourage you to refer to our current [fiskaltrust Documentation Platform](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud).  
For further details, check the corresponding Knowledge Base Articles (KBA), which can be found on the fiskaltrust.Portal.
